## The Antiscam Group (TAG)

The AntiScam Group is a project created by [SocksTheWolf](https://socksthewolf.com) to deal with some of the rampant scams that have been plaguing our communities. It is built up of a group of server admins, moderators and users reporting the scams they receive over Discord.

Even if you don't have your own Discord server, you can join the TAG Discord, and report any scams you get.

Install the [{{site.bot_name}} bot here](/install), [report a scam](/report) or [join the Discord](/discord).
