		<summary>Install without a Moderator Role (<b>ADVANCED</b>)</summary>
		This method is <u>not recommended</u> because there are more chances for errors to occur during runtime, it's usually better and safer to grant the {{ site.bot_name }} a moderator
		role. However, if you would rather not do that for whatever reason, follow these steps to bypass the mod role requirement.
		<ol>
			<li>Move the role in your role management screen like below<br />

{% include notification.html message="Place the newly created role one level _below_ your server's moderator role **OR** one level _above_ your regular members role. 
	This helps prevent Discord permission mismatches that may occasionally occur.

An example of the placement can be seen in the video below:
<div class='embed-container centered is-small'>
	<iframe

		width='700'
		height='480'
		frameborder='0'
		allowfullscreen='true'
		referrerpolicy='strict-origin-when-cross-origin'>
	</iframe>
</div>"  %}
				</li>
				<li>Add the {{ site.bot_name }} role to a moderator channel so it can send important information to it as needed (usually if a ban fails to be applied).</li>
			</ol>
