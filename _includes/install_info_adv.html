		<summary>Install without a Moderator Role (<b>ADVANCED</b>)</summary>
		This method is <u>not recommended</u> because there is a high chance for errors to occur during runtime. As such, it is usually better <i>and safer</i> to grant the {{ site.bot_name }} a moderator
		role. However, if you would rather not do that for whatever reason, follow these steps to bypass the requirement.
		<ol>
			<li>Open your <code>Server Settings > Roles</code> screen</li>
			<li>Scroll down until you find the autogenerated {{ site.bot_name }} role</li>
			<li>Move the {{ site.bot_name }} role higher up using the rules below<br />

{% include notification.html message="Place the newly created role one level _below_ your server's moderator role **OR** one level _above_ your regular members role. 
	This helps prevent Discord permission mismatches that may occasionally occur.

An example of the placement can be seen in the video below:

	</iframe>
</div>"  %}
				</li>
				<li><strong>Optional, but recommended</strong>: Add the {{ site.bot_name }} role to a moderator channel so it can send important information to it as needed (usually if a ban fails to be applied).</li>
