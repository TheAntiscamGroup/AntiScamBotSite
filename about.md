## Scammers are a scourge on our Discord communities

And unless they are banned in all relative servers, they'll hop onto the next server and attempt to scam people from there next.

To stop this from happening, {{ site.bot_name }} was created to share a ban list of known scammers between a network of servers. Through the power of a dedicated Trust and Safety team, community reports and complete transparency in all actions, we've helped **over 400 servers** protect their members from scammers.

> When it comes to something as complicated as automatic ban handling, I want to make sure that you feel safe knowing that the decisions and actions done by {{ site.bot_name }} are **100% auditable**.  
<br />
> **I do not want to have you deal with a case where someone is banned due to drama or disagreements. With {{ site.bot_name }} you won't need to worry.**

Actions will always be published to a dedicated channel in the TAG Server. This feed can optionally be subscribed to within your own server upon bot installation.
